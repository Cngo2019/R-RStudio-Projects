    ###CHANGING DATA INTO FACTORS###

#Lets change some variables into factors to make it easier for us.
#To turn into factors: Sex, PClass, Parch, Embarked
#Combine the test data and training data together
titanicDataTest$Survived <- NA
titanicDataFull <-rbind(titanicData,titanicDataTest)

#Convert categorical data into factors
titanicDataFull$Sex <- as.factor(titanicDataFull$Sex)
titanicDataFull$Parch <-as.factor(titanicDataFull$Parch)
titanicDataFull$Embarked <- as.factor(titanicDataFull$Embarked)
titanicDataFull$Survived<- as.factor(titanicDataFull$Survived)

titanicDataTest$Survived <- as.factor(titanicDataTest$Survived)

#Our test data set now has a survived column
titanicDataTest <- subset(titanicDataFull, PassengerId >= 892)
titanicData <- subset(titanicDataFull, PassengerId < 892)

  ###PREDICTING SURVIVAL###
#Fill in NA values as averages for that specific column

titanicDataTest$Age[is.na(titanicDataTest$Age)] = mean(titanicDataFull$Age,na.rm = TRUE)
titanicDataTest$Fare[is.na(titanicDataTest$Fare)] = mean(titanicDataFull$Fare,na.rm = TRUE)

#I replaced the NA values with the mean age for the entire set
#I repaced the NA values for the Fare with the mean fare for the entire set
#This helps create the model without any NA errors
titanicData$Age[is.na(titanicData$Age)] = mean(titanicDataFull$Age,na.rm = TRUE)
titanicData$Fare[is.na(titanicData$Fare)] = mean(titanicDataFull$Fare,na.rm = TRUE)

myModel <- randomForest (Survived ~ Pclass + Age + Sex + Fare + Embarked, data = titanicData)

titanicDataTest$Survived <- predict(myModel, newdata = titanicDataTest)

submission <- data.frame(titanicDataTest$Survived,titanicDataTest$PassengerId)

#Accuracy for this model by filling in the NA age values for mean(age): 77%
